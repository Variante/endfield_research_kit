# DynamicStreaming main grids and area records

Part of [`../game_data_recovery.md`](../game_data_recovery.md). See
[`README.md`](README.md) for the level and lane map.

**Level 3, world lane.** The main `fb_main_*.bytes`, area `FBStreamArea.bytes`
and version `fb_version.bytes` roots have selected-build generated FlatBuffer
accessors; the auxiliary `fb_init`/`fb_streaming` roots have none. Envelopes
and root framing belong to
[`dynamic_streaming.py`](../../scripts/game_data/dynamic_streaming.py). Field
names come from the reviewed [`contracts/`](../../scripts/game_data/contracts/)
and the modules below, whose docstrings hold layouts and proof detail.

## Shared proof pattern

Each native audit gates on the explicit installed `GameAssembly.dll` and
`global-metadata.dat` (plus `UnityPlayer.dll` for UnityPlayer routes),
matches pinned code windows or named body claims, and fails closed on a
missing or mismatched build. Each corpus gate rejoins every dumped file to
the authenticated VFS ledger by path, length and FileDataMd5 before naming a
field. Changing counts, value distributions, scene sets and receipts live in
the generated reports under `reports/animestudio/` (portal join:
`reports/game_data/`). A **direct conditional** route below is a selected
unpatched body: cache hits, failed lookups, other branches and iFix
`IsPatched` wrappers may take other paths, and no route records what ran in
play.

## Main grids

- **Vector extent (exact).** Selected accessor and builder widths bound every
  current grid vector count word and body without overlap. This is exact
  vector extent, not whole-file closure: grid tables, string bodies, padding
  and nested record fields are not yet owned. `DataMask` stays a raw `UInt64`.
- **Filename (exact).** Every current `fb_main` filename decodes to its own
  root `UniqueId` under the selected `GetPath` packed-ID rule (low byte, next
  byte, one high nibble). Which ID the game requests is open.
- **DataIndex (structural).** Every valid `DataIndex.Grid` equals its
  containing `SingleGrid.UniqueId` (not always the file root's), and for each
  observed `Type` the `Index` values partition the same-named vector exactly.
  Where counts alone are ambiguous the native enum and accessor names decide;
  every observed Type has a nonzero named system route, distinct for the
  count-only rivals.
- **RootComp (structural, plus direct conditional consumer).** RootComp
  `Comps` groups tile each grid's DataIndex directory, and each entity type's
  ordered child Types equal its `comps` list in the exported
  `DynamicSceneTemplates` asset. Natively, `RootComp.Type` keys the typed
  template dictionary that `OnInit` fills from `TEMPLATE_PATH`; grid
  load, reload and enter reach `_ParseLoad`, which walks DataIndex entries
  (bounded by the template's `comps`, not stored `Comps.Num`), routes each
  Type to its system and can call `RegisterEntity`. The IdComp branch reads
  `UniqueId` and rejoins routing.
- **ResourceComp (structural).** Its five groups partition their same-grid
  vectors; each resource descriptor's inner group partitions `Model`,
  `Effect` or `Ecs` targets across grids and files, resolved by scene path
  plus grid ID. The descriptor's state, level and factory scalars have exact
  offsets and no established runtime use.
- **`PrimitiveIntList` closure (structural).** RootComp visibility,
  ResourceGroup visibility and Sludge `SurfTileIDs` spans are disjoint and
  tile each grid's `PrimitiveIntList` exactly. `SurfTileIDs` values are
  nonzero stored tile IDs with no known consumer.

## Visibility and scene state

The nested `VisibleStateGroup`/`VisibleAreaGroup` spans address the grid's
`PrimitiveIntList`. `SceneVisibilityControllerBase.Register` reads each value
through that vector slot for the group chosen by the typed state or area
controller: a **direct conditional consumer**, not a name match. The stored
values join scene-locally (**stored cross-file relations**): every
`VisibleAreaGroup` value is in the same scene's `FBStreamArea.TotalAreas`
(including zero; spaceship-cabin main files have no area file), and every
`VisibleStateGroup` value is an index in the scene's `MapConfig.sceneStates`,
where index zero is a named state.

Those state indices have a named native source. `BaseGameScene` calculates a
mask and index list from the MapConfig conditions (or sets one state by
name) and hands the list through `DynamicStreamingScene.SyncSceneStates` to
the entity and resource systems' state controllers; area changes reach their
area controllers through `OnAreaChanged`. Conditions dispatch to quest,
mission, current-map variable and client-global variable leaves and to
`And`/`Or` trees; variable leaves compare as `Single` with an absolute
tolerance near `1e-5`, and a missing variable returns false. The MapConfig
comes from `DataManager.MapConfigTable` (`Data/Json/MapConfig/<id>.json`)
through normal and seamless loading. In the current export (observed; no
tracked gate rechecks it) every `LevelConfig.mapIdStr` names a MapConfig
whose own `mapIdStr` equals its file stem. Evaluated conditions, the active
state list, and whether a stored RootComp group is registered in play are open.

## Scene to DynamicStreaming files

Every `MapConfig.streamingMapConfigPath` resolves to one exported
`StreamingMapConfig` MonoBehaviour by container, source file and PathID, the
class coming from the original object index (many-to-one; unreferenced
assets stay as unselected candidates). Natively, `GameScene._ExtractSceneConfig`
loads that asset into the typed `BaseGameScene.streamingMapConfig`, and its
`mapSceneName` reaches `DynamicStreamingScene.InitScene`, which builds the
scene base path for `DynamicDataLoader.SetBasePath` (`fb_main`, `fb_init`,
`fb_streaming` templates) and `DynamicSceneVersionBanSet.LoadFromBasePath`
(`fb_version`). The typed chunk loader reads through
`VirtualFileSystem.ReadFileByLowIO` and checks chunk version fields. These
are **direct conditional file-selection and read routes**, not receipts that
a file was requested or accepted. The authored `streamingDataPathRoot`
(`Data/Streaming/...`) is a separate path family from the DynamicStreaming
`Scene` files; the link is `mapSceneName` plus the initializer. One-sided
scene sets stay in the join report and do not show a failed load.

## Version roots and the ban set

- **Layout (exact, direct).** `fb_version` is `Entries`, `Major`, `Minor`;
  each 16-byte entry is `UInt64 Id`, `Int32 Version` and alignment. The
  selected-width reader closes every current file through EOF.
- **Id domain (structural).** Every populated `Entry.Id` occurs as an indexed
  `IdComp.UniqueId` in the same scene's main grids; the entries are a subset,
  never a grid `UniqueId`, and the `map01` control has no overlap.
- **Active version source (direct, conditional).** The enter-game login
  response (`Proto.MSG_B1`, message ID `1`) reaches
  `PlayerInfoSystem.SyncBranchVersion`, which stores string field `f14_` as
  `m_branchVersion`; `_ResolveActiveVersion` parses it with
  `GlobalOptions._ParseVersion` (`v<major>d<minor>` with optional further
  `d<phase>` segments). Active phase defaults to a full-phase sentinel and
  changes only when a parsed output is nonzero, so a matched two-component
  value with a nonzero part sets phase zero while `v0d0` keeps the sentinel.
- **Ban consumer (direct, conditional).** `LoadFromBasePath` exits when the
  phase is at least the sentinel or a path, file, root or major/minor check
  fails; otherwise entries with `Version > activePhase` add their `Id` to
  `m_banned`, and `IsEntityVersionBanned(globalId)` returns
  `m_banned.Contains(globalId)` only when `m_needCheck` is set.

## Auxiliary `fb_init`/`fb_streaming` pairs

- **Stored pairing (exact).** Every current file has its counterpart. Root
  fields 0-1 and vector bodies 2-3 agree, field 4 agrees on its checked prefix
  only, field-5 tables agree in count and shape, and init field 7 and
  streaming field 6 are the complementary nonempty positions.
- **ID, descriptor and blob groups (exact).** Streaming field-6 rows carry
  four-byte IDs; init field-7 rows carry eight-byte descriptors (signed 16-bit
  ID and stride, zero reserved word) and a nested byte blob. Stride times the
  group ID count gives descriptor-major segments that tile the blob, and the
  grouped IDs partition the root field-3 IDs as a multiset.
- **Descriptor 21 (exact stored projection).** One stride-64 descriptor per
  group holds the root field-5 names clipped to 63 bytes: a stored name
  column, not a lossless copy, and not a named runtime component.
- **Native route (direct, conditional).** The ECS load transition passes both
  paths through `AllocateRuntimeChunk_Injected` to a native object that
  stores them separately, requests two streams in one indexed record,
  resolves both ready buffers to FlatBuffer roots, reads init field 7 and
  streaming field 6 at one ordinal, and hands IDs, descriptors and blob to a
  builder that copies stride-times-count bytes per descriptor into per-ID
  destinations. It shares the lookup and stream helpers checked by the IV
  path contract ([`world_irradiance.md`](world_irradiance.md)); the provider
  and VFS file a request chose are open.

## `FBStreamArea` records and area selection

- **Framing (exact).** With the corrected `Int32` widths the six vector count
  words and bodies tile the root tail through EOF; root bounds are inline.
- **Records and relations (direct, structural).** Area, trigger, point and
  bounds records have native offsets. In the populated file, area ranges
  partition `AreaVisibleGroups`, trigger ranges partition `Points`, every
  point lies in its trigger's XY bounds and those bounds are exactly the point
  extrema. The other current files are empty with an inverted-sentinel box.
- **Selection (direct, conditional).** `GameSceneAreaDealer.InitData` reads
  the scene's area file through VFS into a typed root, builds a trigger quad
  tree and seeds its active set from `RootVisible`. `FlushStreamingArea`
  enables areas against that set: nonzero areas go to
  `StreamingSceneV2.SetArea_Injected` and `DynamicStreamingScene.OnAreaChanged`;
  zero takes a default-area layer path. Refreshes query the tree around the
  stored streaming center (plus an optional extra-load sub-center) and apply
  the stored visibility slices.
- **Predicate (direct).** `CheckInArea` applies inclusive X/Z and height
  bounds, then an even-odd ray test over the trigger's closed point ring,
  comparing stored `Coord.Y` with query Z.
- **Centers (direct conditional, stored).** A regular load's center is the
  `pos` that `SquadManager.ServerTeleportSquad` passes to `LoadAtPos`; a
  seamless load's is the portal component's `tpPosition`. Placed portals
  store nondefault `tp_position` overrides, distinct from their world
  position, which the selected `ApplyProperties` route writes into
  `tpPosition`. The placed interactive reaches the allocator through a spawn
  pipeline entered from AOI interest (no dependency group; grid force-load
  and range-exit callers).

## Evidence boundary

Tiers are marked inline above. **Exact** covers VFS identity, vector and
tail framing, the filename-to-root ID and the auxiliary pair bytes;
**direct** covers selected accessors and the conditional native routes;
partitions, the template match and cross-file joins are **structural only**.
**Unresolved:** other nested main fields and whole-file closure; `DataMask`;
auxiliary descriptors other than 21 and whole-root closure; `Entry.Id`
meaning beyond the IdComp join; resource state conditions; a Sludge tile
consumer; live login bytes, branch-version value, registration execution
and repeated-segment captures; and every live selection: MapConfig,
streaming and template asset loads, grid and area activation, evaluated
conditions, version phase, ban results and ban-set reuse, auxiliary file and
provider, the squad teleport `pos` source, portal values and AOI/spawn
execution, polygon-edge equality, patch state. `RootVisible` is an authored
initial-set input, not a runtime receipt.

## Recovery queue

1. A component-ownership witness for descriptor 21 or a source-backed meaning
   for another auxiliary descriptor, with a runtime path/provider receipt.
2. A selected consumer of `SurfTileIDs` and of the ResourceGroup state scalars.
3. Runtime receipts (exact build, caller, file identity) for MapConfig and
   streaming-config selection, grid and area activation, version phase and
   ban results, portal AOI and spawn, and the squad teleport `pos` source.
4. The remaining nested main fields and whole-file closure, then `DataMask`.
