# Story activation and placement carriers

Part of [`../game_data_recovery.md`](../game_data_recovery.md). See
[`README.md`](README.md) for the level and lane map.

**Level 4, story lane.** What a decoded LevelScript action, Timeline record, or
spatial carrier actually owns, reaches, and places -- and the exact-build native
gate and overlay rules that bound every such claim. The Story reconstruction
model these carriers feed, and everything about presenting the result, is
[`../webui/story_recovery.md`](../webui/story_recovery.md).

## LevelScript, Timeline, and native evidence

- LevelScript actions, headers, UIDs, callbacks, lists, and target carriers are
  accepted only through versioned parsers and bounded validation.
- Active evidence uses one logical-path overlay. Persistent replaces the
  complete StreamingAssets file; changed shadow data is decoded from active
  bytes or rejected.
- A direct playback carrier requires one typed header-to-action path. Preload,
  load, stop, sibling actions, foreign headers, unresolved graph shapes, and
  raw numeric hits remain diagnostics.
- CallServer ordering requires one complete linear Story-to-callback-to-Story
  closure with no branch, merge, loop, truncation, or ambiguous target. A
  one-sided path adds no cross-Story edge.
- Timeline track/clip ownership proves authored scheduling, not Director
  activation, selected option, or Wwise playback.
- Native evidence is locked to exact `GameAssembly.dll` and metadata hashes.
  Registration order and code addresses never imply Story order.

## Spatial carriers

Story may be placed on Map only through the exact carrier's own authored
geometry or identity. Maintained carrier families include validated trigger
volumes, constant EntityPtr targets, explicit entity lists, patrol checkpoints,
SpawnerPtr/encounter hosts, NPC proxy dialogs and envTalk, atmospheric NPC
clusters, narrative components, reading points, and exact 3D radio actions.

Each family has its own schema and uniqueness gate. These rules are shared:

- every constant or getter field is decoded in formatter order and bounded by
  exact consumption;
- dynamic blackboard values, runtime lists, nullable outputs, validation
  predicates, sibling actions, mission context, and proximity never substitute
  for the carrier identity;
- one Story may have several exact authored points; do not choose, average, or
  collapse them;
- placement does not prove activation, mission ownership, runtime actor
  position, or chronology;
- changing per-level carrier coverage belongs in generated frontier and map
  reports.
